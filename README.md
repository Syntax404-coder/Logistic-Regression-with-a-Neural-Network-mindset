# Logistic Regression with a Neural Network mindset

Welcome to this programming assignment! You will build a logistic regression classifier to recognize  cats. This assignment will step you through how to do this with a Neural Network mindset, and so will also hone your intuitions about deep learning.

**Instructions:**
- Do not use loops (for/while) in your code, unless the instructions explicitly ask you to do so.

**You will learn to:**
- Build the general architecture of a learning algorithm, including:
    - Initializing parameters
    - Calculating the cost function and its gradient
    - Using an optimization algorithm (gradient descent) 
- Gather all three functions above into a main model function, in the right order.

#### List of Updates
* Forward propagation formula, indexing now starts at 1 instead of 0.
* Optimization function comment now says "print cost every 100 training iterations" instead of "examples".
* Fixed grammar in the comments.
* Y_prediction_test variable name is used consistently.
* Plot's axis label now says "iterations (hundred)" instead of "iterations".
* When testing the model, the test image is normalized by dividing by 255.
